            <h2 class="highlight">Problem Description</h2>
            <p>In this pandemic situation, people are worried that they might have encountered a virus-infected person. 
                We can be questioning about it. “Why do people not know where infected people go or how do people remember the places and time they have gone?” 
                In my opinion, people need to know this information because then people can prevent more from the virus such as not going to the places where infected people went. 
                Furthermore, knowing location and time is very important for “public health surveillance.” 
                Public health surveillance is considering the circumstances of infection and the person’s movements and most countries implement this method. 
                However, most people are reluctant to record or show where they go, so this web app might be caught in privacy issues. 
                Even though this web app can be faced with private information problem, 
                I think it would be okay for now if it can prevent COVID-19 situation.</p>

            <p>One of the existing attempts to solve this problem is that Google tries to track “coronavirus mobility.” 
                Google is recording quarantine activities where people go and time via google map, but from this existing app, 
                I think that Google needs to think the situation that people turn off the location services then, 
                how people record where and when they go.</p>

            <h2 class="highlight">App Description</h2>
            <p>“Path diary (temporary web app name)” is used by everyone who has smart devices or computers. 
                Gathering many data is better for this web app. First of all, everybody can access to this website, 
                but people cannot see other people’s data except the case that the government requires. 
                However, if a user has symptom of coronavirus or any other virus, then the data from the moment 
                the symptom appears will publish to other people with notification and general information (gender and age).
                The main idea of this project is preventing from the virus through tracking their path and showing infected person’s path to other people. 
                From this web app, I want the users to view their own path and coronavirus path in their neighborhood. 
                When they write about the path, I want to show to the users in csv file format. 
                And, in order to inform other people’s information, the users can view map format and csv file format.</p>
            
            <p>In this web app, the users can record their daily life through putting location and time. 
                It is like similar input system when people do tag location via Instagram or Facebook. 
                I want this system to be on the landing page when the user opens this web app. The user can put the location with search box 
                and click “confirm button” to input information to their path diary. Time can be edited manually, 
                but default time will be “current time.” And, the history of path and 
                other people’s path will be located side bar menu at this point.</p>

            <h3 class="sub-highlight">User interaction elements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>search box</li>
                <li>confirm button</li>
                <li>sidebar menu</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>history</li>
                        <li>notification</li>
                        <li>map</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>

            <p>In this pandemic situation, the most people are concerned about encountering infected people from virus, 
                but they do not know where and when the people go, so it makes people more worried. 
                Therefore, from my web app, I want people to reduce their fear from virus through providing the information. 
                Also, from knowing their history of path might be helpful to raise awareness of “stay-at-home.” </p>

            <h3>Project Partner</h3>
            <p>I was looking for my partner for my project, but I have not found yet because I was not sure who is looking for
                partner via MS Team. I want to have the partner who has similiar project idea with me. </p>
